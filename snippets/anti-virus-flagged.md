!!! info "Note: Antivirus software may be flagged"
	It is normal for antivirus software to flag the wallet as potentially dangerous. This is a common issue with most wallets, including Bitcoin's. As long as the wallet was downloaded from [https://scalaris.info](https://scalaris.info), [Scalaris's Github](https://github.com/scalaris-project/scalaris/releases) it can be deemed as safe and the warning can be ignored. You may need to temporarily disable antivirus download protection to complete the download.
