??? question "Why shouldn't I store my funds on an exchange?"
	While you can store your funds on an exchange, it is risky to do so since you don't really own the wallet your funds are stored in. In other words, when you use an exchange, your funds are really in the exchanges "account" and they are just allowing you access.

	These exchanges are highly unregulated, which can lead to issues. They have the ability to freeze withdrawals of funds, and while the exchange owners can tell users that their funds are safe, there is no way to guarantee this given the lack of rules and a regulating body.

	Due to the large number of funds being stored on exchanges, it becomes a target for hackers. There is a huge risk storing funds on an exchange with [$1.7 billion stolen from exchanges in 2018](https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-theft-skyrocketed-2-billion/) alone.
