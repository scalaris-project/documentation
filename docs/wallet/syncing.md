title: Scalaris Wallet Syncing Guide
description: This guide explains how to sync your Scalaris wallet with and without bootstrap chain files containing the Scalaris blockchain.


# Syncing the Wallet
Whenever you start the wallet, it must sync with the blockchain. This means that it is downloading all the data (accounts and transactions) on the Scalaris blockchain. This process is required for the wallet to function properly.

??? info "Note: Wallet balance may be incorrect until fully synced."
	When the wallet syncs, it downloads the data in chronological order. Therefore, if the wallet is not fully synced, it may not reflect recent transactions. This can cause the an incorrect balance to be shown until syncing is finished.

## Synchronization

When the wallet is opened, it begins syncing automatically. If this is the first time syncing the wallet or if you haven't opened the wallet in a few weeks.
