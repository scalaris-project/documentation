description: This guide explains how to initialize, backup and restore your XLite wallet on each operating system.

## First Time Open XLite

??? example "Windows"

	* Double-click on the XLite icon wherever you installed it in the [Installation](/xlite/installation) step. 

	    ??? info "Note: If you see a *Security Warning* from Windows asking if you want to *Run* the file, it is safe to click *Run*, assuming you have [verified your download](/xlite/installation/#verifying-downloads-recommended)."

	    ??? info "If XLite doesn't open when you double-click it, click here"
		1. Install [Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632).
		1. [Redo the installation step](/xlite/installation).

??? example "MacOS"

	1. Open the [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201732) from
      [the dock](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/mac-help/mh35859/mac),
	  then click on *Applications* on the left side of the Finder window to reveal a
      screen like this:

		security precautions your Mac takes when opening a new application
		for the first time.

	If you downloaded and installed XLite from the `.tar.gz` file,

	1. In a Terminal window, type `cd <install-dir>/XLite-x.x.x-linux`
       where `install-dir` is the directory where you moved the
       `XLite-x.x.x-linux` directory after extracting it, and `x.x.x.` is the version you
       downloaded.
	1. Type, `./xlite` to run the application.

#### After opening and unlocking XLite, you'll see a screen something like this:

![XLite Dashboard](/img/xlite/dashboard.png)

__To back up your wallet's 12 word mnemonic passphrase:__

1. Select *Settings->Backup*
1. Enter your password.
1. Click *Download backup file*.
1. Select Download location
1. Click *Save*
1. Make copies of your wallet's mnemonic phrase to at least 3
physically different locations. You can copy the mnemonic phrase backup file to a private USB
thumb drive (preferably encrypting it first). You can also print or write
your mnemonic phrase on pieces of
paper and store them in different locations.
1. After storing your mnemonic phrase in 3+ locations, __*delete the
   mnemonic phrase backup file from your computer, then empty the trash!*__ Leave no
   trace of your 12 word mnemonic phrase on your computer in an
   unencrypted form.

##### Force Creation of a New XLite Wallet

??? Tip "Tip: Force Creation of a New XLite Wallet."

	On rare occasion, you may want to force a brand new wallet to be
    created. For Example, maybe you can't remember your password, lost
    your mnemonic passphrase, and don't have any funds in your XLite
    wallet worth saving. In such a case, you can force a new wallet to
    be created by moving (or removing) both the `CloudChains`
    and `xlite` directories. Moving/renaming those
    directories is recommended, but if you are 100% certain there are
    no funds in your XLite wallet that might be worth saving, you can
    remove/delete those directories.
	
	The locations of the `CloudChains` and `xlite` directories are as follows:

	* Windows: `%appdata%`
	
	* MacOS:  `~/Library/Application Support/`

	* Linux: `~/.config/`

	Once you have moved or removed the `CloudChains` and `xlite`
    directories, the next time you start XLite you'll see the
    [screen from which you can create a brand new wallet](#the-first-time-you-open-xlite-after-installing-it-youll-see-this-screen)
